===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

FROGGER ARCADE GAME
======================================

Playing Instructions
---------------------------------------
The objective is simple, the player has to reach the uppermost tile row without being hit by the crossing vehicles. However, the game doesn't end there, as the game will reset with faster traveling vehicles everytime a player reaches the uppermost tile row. If the player is hit by a vehicle, he will lose a life. If the player is hit and has 0 lives, it's game over :(. It's all about your score, the more times you are able to reach the top, the more points you will add to your score. Some other interesting items
will appear in your game:

1. Obstacle - He will make your life impossible, You Shall Not Pass!

2. Heart - This item will grant you a new life. A lifesaver!

3. Apple - This item will increase your score by 45 points.

4. Berry - This item will increase your score by 90 points.

5. Banana - This is the jackpot! +250 points if you get this one.
			However, it's not easy to encounter.


Max Score -  There is no max score set in the game, you can play infinitely. However,
			 crossing the stoned tiles will be a daunting task at those high speeds.


WHAT HAPPENS IF I LOSE?
Your score is set to 0, lives to 2, and enemies will start moving slow again.


WHY DON'T YOU SAVE MY SCORE?
unfortunately, there isn't any database set for this project. However I promise that in the future I will implement some serverside code to show who gets the higher score, once I upload it to my website. Maybe I will add more interesting animations? make the character walk? make some nicer sprites, add new characters? All of this is possible.
